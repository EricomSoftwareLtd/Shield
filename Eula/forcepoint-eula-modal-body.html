</p>
<p>Subject to the provisions contained in this Agreement, and timely payment of the applicable fees, Forcepoint hereby
    grants Subscriber, for the Subscription Term, a Subscription to use the Products, receive Technical Support, and
    access the Cloud Services (including any output of the Services Offerings), identified in the Order solely for
    Subscriber’s internal business purposes up to the Permitted Capacity set forth in the Order. Subject to compliance
    with the terms of this Agreement, Subscriber may relocate or transfer the on-premise Product for use on a different
    server within its location. Subscriber will not and may not permit any third party to copy the on-premise Products,
    other than copies made solely for data backup and internal testing purposes. Any source code provided to Subscriber
    by Forcepoint is subject to the terms of this Agreement. Forcepoint may make changes to the Products at any time
    without notice. Subscriber understands that its right to use the Products is limited by the Permitted Capacity
    purchased, and Subscriber use may in no event exceed the Permitted Capacity authorized under the applicable Order.
    The Permitted Capacity provided in the Order(s) represents minimum amounts that Subscriber has committed to for the
    Subscription Term. If Subscriber’s use exceeds the Permitted Capacity, Subscriber must purchase additional Permitted
    Capacity sufficient for the balance of the then-current Subscription Term to cover the excess use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    <b>3. <u>Provision of Cloud Services.</u></b>
</p>
<p>3.1 Forcepoint will use reasonable efforts to provide Cloud Services for the Subscription Term. The then-current
    Cloud Services service levels are incorporated by reference into this Agreement and may be found at: <a
        href="https://www.forcepoint.com/forcepoint-cloud-services-service-level-agreement" target="_blank">Cloud
        Services Service Level Agreement</a>. Forcepoint makes no service level commitments when Cloud Services are used
    in connection with Bulk Mail. Forcepoint makes no service level commitments for the Cloud Services’ functionality to
    the extent it is used to monitor access to third-party services where the continued availability of the
    functionality is adversely impacted by the third-party’s access policies.</p>
<p>3.2 If Forcepoint determines that the Products are being used to distribute Spam or Malware, or that the security or
    proper function of Cloud Services would be compromised due to hacking, denial of service attacks or other activities
    originating from or directed at Subscriber’s network, then Forcepoint may immediately suspend Cloud Services until
    the problem is resolved. Forcepoint will promptly notify and work with Subscriber to resolve the issues.</p>
<p>3.3 If Cloud Services are suspended or terminated, Forcepoint will reverse all configuration changes made during
    Cloud Services enrollment. It is Subscriber’s responsibility to make the server configuration changes necessary to
    reroute any email, Web Content, and traffic flowing through the Cloud Services.</p>
<p>3.4 Forcepoint may modify, enhance, replace, or make additions to the Products. Forcepoint may use Malware, Spam, and
    other information passing through the Products for the purposes of developing, analyzing, maintaining, reporting on,
    and enhancing the Products and services.</p>
<p>3.5 Prior to enrollment in Cloud Services and at any time during the Subscription Term, Forcepoint may test whether
    Subscriber’s email system is acting as an Open Relay. If Forcepoint finds the system is an Open Relay, Forcepoint
    will inform Subscriber and may suspend the applicable Cloud Services until the problem is resolved.</p>
<p>3.6 If in any one calendar month the total number of emails processed in performance of Cloud Services for inbound
    and outbound scanning of email traffic divided by the Permitted Capacity is greater than either: (i) 10,000 emails
    per User, then Subscriber will make reasonable efforts to implement and maintain an accurate list of all valid email
    addresses belonging to Subscriber for which Cloud Services scan inbound or outbound email; or (ii) 30,000 emails per
    User, then Forcepoint may terminate the applicable Cloud Services Subscription upon 30 days prior written notice
    unless Subscriber purchases Subscriptions to increase the Permitted Capacity.</p>
<p>3.7 If in any one calendar month the total bandwidth used in the performance of Cloud Services for web access
    filtering divided by the Permitted Capacity is greater than 0.02Mbps, then Forcepoint may terminate the applicable
    Cloud Services Subscription upon 30 days prior written notice unless Subscriber purchases Subscriptions to increase
    the Permitted Capacity.</p>
<p>3.8 If in any one calendar month the total bandwidth used in the performance of Cloud Services for security access
    policy enforcement solution divided by the number of Devices or Users is greater than 0.02Mbps, then Forcepoint may
    terminate the applicable Cloud Services Subscription upon 30 days prior written notice unless Subscriber purchases
    Subscriptions to increase the Permitted Capacity.</p>
<p>3.9 If in any one calendar month the total throughput including data sent and received through Cloud Services for
    internet and internal application access policy enforcement divided by the number of Users is greater than 10
    Gigabytes per User, then Forcepoint may terminate the applicable Cloud Services Subscription upon 30 days prior
    written notice unless Subscriber purchases additional Permitted Capacity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    <b>4. <u>Subscriber Obligations.</u></b>
</p>

<p>4.3 Subscriber acknowledges that the scoring and content by some Products is based on available information at the
    time it is gathered and may be incomplete, misinterpreted, and is subject to change at any time. As such it is

<p>4.5 Subscriber will defend, indemnify and hold Forcepoint harmless against any loss, award, damage, or costs

    granting resource access to information, systems, and licenses related to the scope of the project; (iv) providing
    building and network access before, during, and after normal business hours, work space, and workstations for each
    of the Forcepoint personnel, logon IDs and security access to all required Products, and adequate test environment,
    and any reasonable and appropriate data to perform the Services Offerings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    <b>5. <u>Subscriber Obligations.</u></b>
</p>
<p>5.1 Technical Support is provided under the then-current Forcepoint technical support policies, as described at: <a
    href="https://www.forcepoint.com/technical-support-terms-service-and-description" target="_blank">Technical Support
    Description</a>. Technical Support, Database Updates and Software Upgrades will be provided to Subscriber only if
    Subscriber has paid the applicable Subscription Fees. Forcepoint may require Subscriber to install Software Upgrades
    up to and including the latest release.</p>
<p>5.2 Forcepoint’s obligation to provide Technical Support is limited to: (i) a Product that has not been altered or
    modified by anyone other than Forcepoint or its licensors; (ii) a release for which technical support is provided;
    (iii) Subscriber’s use of the Product in accordance with the Documentation; and (iv) errors and malfunctions caused
    by systems or programs supplied by Forcepoint. If an Error has been corrected or is not present in a more current
    version of the Product, Forcepoint will provide the more current version via Technical Support but will not have any
    obligation to correct such Error in prior versions.</p>
<p>5.3 Technical Support for on-premise Products may be limited to the most current release and the most recent previous
    sequential major release of the Product. Forcepoint reserves the right to terminate the Subscription or increase the
    associated fees upon 60 days’ notice should Subscriber not stay current with a supported release in accordance with
    this Section.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    <b>6. <u>Intellectual Property Rights.</u></b>
</p>
<p>All right, title, and interest in and to the Products, any modifications, translations, or derivatives thereof
    including any related scripts, tools, and know-how and all applicable intellectual property and proprietary rights
    thereto remain exclusively with Forcepoint or its licensors. The Products may include software products licensed
    from third parties. Such third parties have no obligations or liability to Subscriber under this Agreement but are
    third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement. Forcepoint owns any suggestions, ideas, enhancement requests, feedback,
    or recommendations provided by Subscriber relating to the Products. Except as otherwise expressly provided,
    Forcepoint grants no express or implied right under Forcepoint patents, copyrights, trademarks, or other
    intellectual property rights, and all rights not expressly granted to Subscriber in this Agreement are reserved to
    Forcepoint and its licensors. Subscriber may not remove any proprietary notice of Forcepoint or any third-party from
    the Products or any copy of the Products, without Forcepoint’s prior written consent. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    <b>7. <u>Protection and Restrictions.</u></b>
</p>
<p>7.1 Each party (the “Disclosing Party”) may disclose to the other (the “Receiving Party”) certain confidential
    technical and business information that the Disclosing Party desires the Receiving Party to treat as confidential.
    "Confidential Information" means any information disclosed by either party to the other party, either directly or
    indirectly, in writing, orally, electronically or by inspection of tangible objects (including without limitation
    prototypes, technical data, trade secrets and know-how, product plans, Products, customer lists and customer
    information, prices and costs, databases, inventions, processes, hardware configuration information, finances,
    budgets and other business information), which is designated as "Confidential," "Proprietary" or some similar
    designation at or prior to the time of disclosure, or that should otherwise reasonably be considered confidential by
    the Receiving Party. Confidential Information may also include information disclosed to a Disclosing Party by third
    parties. Confidential Information will not, however, include any information that the Receiving Party can document
    (i) was publicly known and made generally available prior to the time of disclosure by the Disclosing Party or an
    authorized third party; (ii) becomes publicly known and made generally available after disclosure through no action
    or inaction of the Receiving Party in violation of any obligation of confidentiality; (iii) is already in the
    possession of the Receiving Party at the time of disclosure; (iv) is lawfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a
    third party without a breach of such third party's obligations of confidentiality; or (v) is independently developed
    by the Receiving Party without use of or reference to the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information. The Receiving
    Party will treat all Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party as non-public confidential information and
    will not disclose it to any person other than Disclosing Party and employees and contractors of Receiving Party on a
    need to know basis and that Receiving Party will protect the confidentiality of such Confidential Information in the
    same manner that it protects the confidentiality of its own proprietary and confidential information, but in no
    event with less than a reasonable standard of care. Subscriber’s use of the Products to process data is not a
    disclosure of Confidential Information to Forcepoint for purposes of this Section. Furthermore, neither party will
    use the Confidential Information of the other party for any purpose other than carrying out its rights and
    obligations under this Agreement.</p>
<p>7.2 Subscriber will take all reasonable steps to safeguard the Products to ensure that no unauthorized person has
    access and that no unauthorized copy, publication, disclosure, or distribution, in any form is made. The Products
    contain valuable, confidential information and trade secrets and unauthorized use or copying is harmful to
    Forcepoint. Subscriber may use the Products only for the internal business purposes of Subscriber. Subscriber may
    not assign more than 20 administrators to administer certain Forcepoint products. Subscriber will not itself, or
    through any affiliate, employee, consultant, contractor, agent or other third-party: (i) sell, resell, distribute,
    host, lease, rent, license or sublicense, in whole or in part, the Products; (ii) decipher, decompile, disassemble,
    reverse assemble, modify, translate, reverse engineer or otherwise attempt to derive source code, algorithms, tags,
    specifications, architecture, structure or other elements of the Products, in whole or in part, for competitive
    purposes or otherwise; (iii) allow access to, provide, divulge or make available the Products to any user other than
    Subscriber’s employees and contractors who have a need to such access and who will be bound by nondisclosure
    obligations that are at least as restrictive as the terms of this Agreement; (iv) write or develop any derivative
    works based upon the Products; (v) modify, adapt, translate or otherwise make any changes to the Products or any
    part thereof; (vi) use the Products to provide processing services to third-parties, or otherwise use the same on a
    ‘service bureau’ basis; (vii) disclose or publish, without Forcepoint’s prior written consent, performance or
    capacity statistics or the results of any benchmark test performed on the Products; (viii) otherwise use or copy the
    same except as expressly permitted herein; (ix) use any third-party software included in the Products independently
    from the Forcepoint proprietary Products. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Subscriber may allow its agents
    and independent contractors to use the Products solely for the benefit of Subscriber; provided, however, Subscriber
    remains responsible for any breach of this Agreement. Any other use of the Products by any other entity is forbidden
    and a violation of this Agreement. Subscriber must not use the Products to filter, screen, manage or censor Internet
    content for consumers without permission from the affected consumers and Forcepoint’s express prior written
    approval, which may be withheld in Forcepoint’s sole discretion. If any additional third-party end-user license
    agreement or open source software license agreement is (a) attached to this Agreement or the Order, or (b) included
    in the Product “about” file, “readme” file or Documentation, then Subscriber’s use of the third-party software is
    further restricted by and subject to such license.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    <b>8. <u>Financial Terms.</u></b>
</p>
<p>Fees and payment terms are specified in the applicable Order. Except as otherwise expressly specified in the Order:
    (i) all recurring payment obligations start from the receipt of the Order; (ii) when the Order is placed directly
    with Forcepoint fees must be paid within 30 days after the invoice date; (iii) upon the expiration of each
    Subscription Term, the Subscription Fees will be Forcepoint’s then-current commercial list price for such Products;
    and (iv) interest accrues on past due balances at the highest rate allowed by law. Failure to make timely payments
    is a material breach of the Agreement and Forcepoint will be entitled to suspend any or all of its performance
    obligations hereunder in accordance with the provisions of Section 12 and to modify the payment terms, including
    requiring full payment before Forcepoint performs any obligations in this Agreement. Subscriber will reimburse
    Forcepoint for any expenses incurred, including interest and reasonable attorney fees, in collecting amounts due to
    Forcepoint hereunder that are not under good faith dispute by Subscriber. Amounts paid or payable for Products are
    not contingent upon the performance of any consulting or other professional services. Forcepoint’s reasonable travel
    and lodging expenses incurred in the performance of services on Subscriber’s site will be billed separately at
    actual cost. Subscriber is responsible for payment of all taxes (excluding those on Forcepoint's net income) arising
    out of this Agreement, except to the extent a valid tax exemption certificate or other written documentation
    acceptable to Forcepoint to evidence Subscriber’s tax exemption status is provided by Subscriber to Forcepoint prior
    to the delivery of Products or services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    <b>9. <u>Limited Warranty; Remedies; Disclaimer. </u></b>
</p>
<p>9.1 For the Subscription Term, Forcepoint warrants that the Products (other than Services Offerings), as updated from
    time to time by Forcepoint and used in accordance with the Documentation and the Agreement by Subscriber, will
    operate in substantial conformance with the Documentation under normal use. Forcepoint warrants that Services
    Offerings will be performed in a professional and workmanlike manner and Forcepoint will comply with all applicable
    laws in providing the Services Offerings. Forcepoint does not warrant that: (A) the Products will (i) be free of
    defects, (ii) satisfy Subscriber’s requirements, (iii) operate without interruption or error, (iv) always locate or
    block access to or transmission of all desired addresses, emails, Malware, applications and/or files, or (v)
    identify every transmission or file that should potentially be located or blocked; (B) data contained in the
    Databases will be (i) appropriately categorized or (ii) that the algorithms used in the Products will be complete or
    accurate; or (C) data contained in and risk scoring from the Cloud Services will be complete or interpreted
    correctly.</p>
<p>9.2 Subscriber must promptly notify Forcepoint in writing of a claim. Provided that such claim is reasonably
    determined by Forcepoint to be Forcepoint’s responsibility, Forcepoint will, within 30 days of its receipt of
    Subscriber’s written notice, (i) correct the Error or provide a workaround; (ii) provide Subscriber with a plan
    reasonably acceptable to Subscriber for correcting the Error; or (iii) if neither (i) nor (ii) can be accomplished
    with reasonable efforts from Forcepoint at Forcepoint’s discretion, then Forcepoint may terminate the affected
    Product Subscription and Subscriber will be entitled to a refund of the unused Subscription Fees paid for the
    affected Product applicable to the balance of the then-current Subscription Term. This paragraph sets forth
    Subscriber’s sole and exclusive remedy and Forcepoint's entire liability for any breach of warranty or other duty
    related to the Products.</p>
<p>9.3 This warranty is void and Forcepoint is not obligated to provide technical support if a claimed breach of the
    warranty is caused by: (i) any unauthorized modification of the Products or tampering with the Products, (ii) use of
    the Products inconsistent with the accompanying Documentation, (iii) Subscriber’s failure to use any new or
    corrected versions of the Product made available by Forcepoint; or (iv) breach of this Agreement by Subscriber or
    its users.</p>
<p>9.4 THE WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 9 ARE IN LIEU OF, AND FORCEPOINT, ITS LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS EXPRESSLY
    DISCLAIM TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT
    LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, TITLE OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
    AND FREEDOM FROM PROGRAM ERRORS, VIRUSES OR ANY OTHER MALICIOUS CODE WITH RESPECT TO THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
    PROVIDED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    <b>10. <u>Limited Warranty; Remedies; Disclaimer.</u></b>
</p>
<p>NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS AGREEMENT, FORCEPOINT, ITS AFFILIATES, ITS LICENSORS OR RESELLERS
    WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR (I) LOST PROFITS; (II) LOSS OF BUSINESS; (III) LOSS OF GOODWILL, OPPORTUNITY, OR REVENUE;
    (IV) SUBSCRIBER’S DECISIONS BASED ON ITS INTERPRETATION OF THE OUTPUT FROM THE PRODUCTS; NOR (V) ANY INDIRECT,
    CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT WHETHER
    FORESEEABLE OR UNFORESEEABLE INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO CLAIMS FOR USE OF THE PRODUCTS, INTERRUPTION IN USE OR
    AVAILABILITY OF DATA, STOPPAGE OF OTHER WORK OR IMPAIRMENT OF OTHER ASSETS, PRIVACY, ACCESS TO OR USE OF ANY
    ADDRESSES, EXECUTABLES OR FILES THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN LOCATED OR BLOCKED, NEGLIGENCE, BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT OR
    OTHERWISE AND THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL FORCEPOINT’S
    AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT ACTUALLY RECEIVED BY
    FORCEPOINT FOR THE SUBSCRIBER’S APPLICABLE SUBCRIPTION TO THE PRODUCTS OVER THE ONE YEAR PERIOD PRIOR TO THE EVENT
    OUT OF WHICH THE CLAIM AROSE FOR THE PRODUCTS THAT DIRECTLY CAUSED THE LIABILITY. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    <b>11. <u>Intellectual Property Indemnification</u></b>
</p>
<p>In the event of a third-party claim, suit or proceeding against Subscriber asserting that use of the Product as
    permitted in this Agreement infringes a third-party’s patent, copyright, or trademark right recognized in any
    jurisdiction where the Product is licensed, Forcepoint at its expense will defend Subscriber and indemnify
    Subscriber against costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), and damages payable to any third party in
    any such suit or cause of action that are directly related to that claim. Forcepoint’s obligation under this Section
    is contingent upon Subscriber providing Forcepoint with: (a) prompt written notice of the suit or claim; (b) the
    right to solely control and direct the defense of the claim; and (c) reasonable cooperation. Subscriber may
    participate in the defense at its own expense. Forcepoint will have no liability for any claim of infringement
    resulting from: (i) modification of the Products by anyone other than Forcepoint; (ii) a combination of the Products
    with other hardware or software not provided by Forcepoint; or (iii) failure by Subscriber to implement Software
    Upgrades and Database Updates. In the event the Products, in Forcepoint’s opinion, are likely to or do become the
    subject of a claim of infringement, Forcepoint may at its sole option and expense: (x) modify the Products to be
    non-infringing while preserving equivalent functionality; (y) obtain a license for Subscriber’s continued use of the
    Products; or (z) terminate this Agreement and the license granted hereunder, accept return of the Products and
    refund to Subscriber the unused Subscription Fees paid for the affected Product applicable to the balance of the
    then-current Subscription Term. THIS SECTION SETS FORTH FORCEPOINT’S ENTIRE LIABILITY AND OBLIGATION AND
    SUBSCRIBER’S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY INFRINGEMENT OR CLAIMS OF INFRINGEMENT.</p>

</p>
<p>12.1 This Agreement continues in full force and effect until the expiration or termination of the Order(s), unless
    otherwise terminated earlier or auto-renews as provided hereunder. All Orders are non-cancellable, and there will be
    no fee adjustments or refunds for any reason, including decreases in usage, or otherwise during the Subscription
    Term. Subscriptions to Cloud Services will auto-renew on a month-to-month basis at Forcepoint’s then-current
    commercial list price until terminated with at least 30 days’ notice by either party unless a longer Subscription
    Term has been agreed upon in an Order. Upon termination or expiration of the Subscription Term, Subscriber’s right
    to use the Products terminates.</p>
<p>12.2 Product evaluation subscriptions are available for a period of up to 30 days, and limited availability Product
    subscriptions may be available for the time period determined by Forcepoint. Product evaluation subscriptions and
    limited availability Product subscriptions are each subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, except
    however that: (i) evaluation subscriptions and limited availability Product subscriptions may only be used to
    evaluate and facilitate Subscriber’s decision to purchase a subscription to Products; and (ii) evaluation
    subscriptions and limited availability Product subscriptions are provided by Forcepoint on an AS IS and AS AVAILABLE
    basis without warranties of any kind. At the end of the evaluation period or the limited availability Product
    subscription period, Subscriber must place an Order and pay the applicable Subscription Fees, or this Agreement
    terminates as related to the evaluation subscription or limited availability Product subscription. Subscriber’s
    continued use of the Products after an evaluation or limited availability Product subscription period is subject to
    this Agreement.</p>
<p>12.3 Either party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice at any time if: (i) the other party
    commits a non-remediable material breach of the Agreement, or if the other party fails to cure any remediable
    material breach or provide a written plan of cure acceptable to the non-breaching party within 30 days of being
    notified in writing of such breach, except for breach of payment terms, which will have a 10 day cure period; or
    (ii) the other party ceases business operations; or (iii) the other party becomes insolvent, generally stops paying
    its debts as they become due or seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors
    arrangement, composition or comparable proceeding, or if any such proceeding is instituted against the other (and
    not dismissed within 90 days after commencement of one of the foregoing events). Upon notification of termination by
    either party, Subscriber must uninstall any Products, cease using and destroy or return all copies of the Products
    to Forcepoint, and to certify in writing that all known copies thereof, including backup copies, have been
    destroyed. Sections 1, 6-12, and 14-17 will survive the termination of this Agreement.</p>
<p>12.4 Forcepoint will be entitled to suspend any or all services upon 10 days written notice to Subscriber in the
    event Subscriber is in breach of this Agreement. Forcepoint may impose an additional charge to reinstate service
    following suspension.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    <b>13. <u>Compliance with Laws.</u></b>
</p>
<p>Each party will comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including but not limited to the European Union’s
    General Data Protection Regulation, that may apply to issues including the protection of personal data, and
    anti-bribery. Subscriber must obtain any required consents (including employee consent) addressing the interception,
    reading, copying, analyzing, or filtering of emails and their attachments as well as any local government permits,
    licenses, or approvals required to use the Products. Neither party will use any data obtained via the Products for
    any unlawful purpose. Each party’s obligations with respect to the treatment of personal data submitted to
    Forcepoint pursuant to this Agreement are set forth in the terms of the <a

        Agreement</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    <b>14. <u>Rights of Government Subscribers.</u></b>
</p>
<p>The Products meet the definition of “commercial item” in Federal Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”) 2.101, were developed
    entirely at private expense, and are provided to Government Subscribers exclusively under the terms of this
    Agreement. Software, including Software Upgrades, is “commercial computer software” and applicable Documentation and
    media are “commercial computer software documentation,” as those terms are used in FAR 12.212 and DFARS 227.7202.
    Use of the Products by the U.S. Government constitutes acknowledgment of Forcepoint's proprietary rights therein,
    and of the exclusive applicability of this Agreement. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    <b>15. <u>Export.</u></b>
</p>
<p>Commodities, technology, and software, including the Products (collectively referred to as “items”) are subject to
    the export control laws of the United States and other countries that may lawfully control the export of such items.
    Moreover, the furnishing of support services with respect to items that are controlled as defense or military items
    may also be subject to such laws. Subscriber will not transfer such items or furnish such services except in
    compliance with the export laws of the United States and any other country that may lawfully control the export of
    such items or the provision of such services. Subscriber will indemnify and hold Forcepoint harmless from any
    claims, liabilities, penalties, forfeitures, and associated costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) that
    Forcepoint may incur due to Subscriber’s non-compliance with applicable export laws, rules, and regulations.
    Subscriber will immediately notify Forcepoint of any violation of any export law, rule, or regulation, which may
    affect Forcepoint or relate to the activities covered under this Agreement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    <b>16. <u>Verification.</u></b>
</p>
<p>Upon Forcepoint’s request, Subscriber will provide a written certification confirming its compliance with this
    Agreement. Further, during the Subscription Term and one year thereafter, Forcepoint or Forcepoint’s independent
    auditor may review Subscriber’s records related to Subscriber’s use of the Products to verify Subscriber’s
    compliance with this Agreement. Subscriber will provide reasonable assistance, access to personnel, facilities, and
    systems, as well as information necessary to facilitate Forcepoint’s compliance verification. The verification will
    be performed during regular business hours and will not interfere unreasonably with Subscriber’s business
    activities. The cost of the verification will be borne by Forcepoint unless a discrepancy indicating that additional
    Subscription Fees are due to Forcepoint, in which case the reasonable cost of the verification will be borne by
    Subscriber. Subscriber will promptly cure any noncompliance and will pay any Subscription Fees due as a result of
    such noncompliance. The rights and remedies under this Section are in addition to any other rights Forcepoint may
    have under this Agreement. Additionally, Forcepoint may at any time, without notice, during the term of this
    Agreement access Subscriber’s system, subject to applicable local law, to determine whether Subscriber and its users
    are complying with the terms of this Agreement. Subscriber acknowledges that the Products may include a license
    manager component to track usage of the Products and Subscriber will not impede, disable, or otherwise undermine
    such license manager’s operation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    <b>17. <u>General.</u></b>
</p>
<p>17.1 For the purposes of customer service, technical support, and as a means of facilitating interactions with its
    end-users, Forcepoint may periodically send Subscriber messages of an informational or advertising nature via email
    and provide account information to related third parties (e.g. Subscriber’s reseller). Information will be processed
    by Forcepoint in accordance with the <a href="https://www.forcepoint.com/privacy-policy" target="_blank">Privacy
        Policy</a> and applicable data privacy laws. Subscriber may at any time update its communications preferences on
    Forcepoint.com or by sending an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@forcepoint.com" target="_blank">privacy@forcepoint.com</a>.
    Subscriber acknowledges and agrees that if it chooses not to receive informational or advertising messages, then it
    will not receive Forcepoint emails concerning upgrades and enhancements to Products. However, Forcepoint may still
    send emails of a technical nature. Forcepoint may use non-identifying and aggregate usage and statistical
    information collected in relation to Subscribers’ and its users’ use of the Products for purposes outside of the
    Agreement. Subscriber acknowledges that Forcepoint may use Subscriber's company name only in a general list of
    Forcepoint customers.</p>
<p>17.2 Subscriber may not transfer any of Subscriber’s rights to use the Products or assign this Agreement to another
    person or entity, without first obtaining prior written approval from Forcepoint.</p>
<p>17.3 Any notice required or permitted under this Agreement or required by law must be in writing and must be (i)
    delivered in person, (ii) sent by first class registered mail, or air mail, as appropriate, or (iii) sent by an
    internationally recognized overnight air courier, in each case properly posted and fully prepaid. Notices sent to
    Forcepoint must be sent to the attention of the General Counsel at 10900-A Stonelake Blvd., 3rd Floor, Austin, TX
    78759 USA. Notices sent to Subscriber will be sent to Subscriber’s address in Forcepoint’s system of record. Notices
    are considered to have been received at the time of actual delivery in person, two business days after deposit in
    the mail as set forth above, or one day after delivery to an overnight air courier service. Either party may change
    its contact person for notices and/or address for notice by means of notice to the other party given in accordance
    with this paragraph.</p>
<p>17.4 Any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach thereof will be governed by the federal
    laws of the United States and the laws of the State of Delaware, USA, for all claims arising in or related to the
    United States, Canada, Japan, or Mexico and Dublin, Ireland for all other claims, without regard to or application
    of choice of laws, rules or principles. Both parties hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of: the state and
    federal courts in Austin, Texas, USA, for all claims arising in or related to the United States, Canada, Japan or
    Mexico, and the competent courts in Dublin, Ireland for all other claims, provided however that Forcepoint may seek
    injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to protect its intellectual property. Both parties
    expressly waive any objections or defense based upon lack of personal jurisdiction or venue.</p>
<p>17.5 Neither party will be liable for any delay or failure in performance to the extent the delay or failure is
    caused by events beyond the party’s reasonable control, including, fire, flood, acts of God, explosion, war or the
    engagement of hostilities, strike, embargo, labor dispute, government requirement, civil disturbances, civil or
    military authority, disturbances to the Internet, and inability to secure materials or transportation
    facilities.</p>
<p>17.6 This Agreement is the entire agreement between the parties regarding the subject matter herein and the parties
    have not relied on any promise, representation, or warranty, express or implied, that is not in this Agreement.
    Subscriber agrees that this Agreement is neither contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features
    nor dependent on any oral or written comments made by Forcepoint regarding future functionality or features. Any
    waiver or modification of this Agreement is only effective if it is in writing and signed by both parties or posted
    by Forcepoint at: <a href="https://www.forcepoint.com/company/terms-and-conditions" target="_blank">Legal
        Information</a>. Forcepoint is not obligated under any other agreements unless they are in writing and signed by
    an authorized representative of Forcepoint. All pre-printed or standard terms of any Subscriber’s purchase order or
    other business processing document have no effect, and the terms and conditions of this Agreement will prevail over
    such forms, and any additional, inconsistent, conflicting, or different terms in such forms will be void and of no
    force and effect. In the event of a conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of an Order, the
    terms of this Agreement prevail.</p>
<p>17.7 If any part of this Agreement is found invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the
    remainder of this Agreement will be interpreted so as reasonably to affect the intention of the parties.</p>
