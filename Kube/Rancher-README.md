### Add Node/s To Your Cluster

From the Rancher Windows, Click on the "Copy To Clipboard" Button

Run the copied command on EACH Linux machine to join it to the cluster. Make sure the copied command matches the
node to join (**Master**/**Worker**). Follow the node joining by clicking on ``Nodes`` in the cluster menu.

Wait until the process is finished. After the node is joined to the cluster, a green message appears at the bottom of the page.
Repeat this process per each node until the cluster is complete. Click ``Done``.
